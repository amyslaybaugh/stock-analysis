# stock-analysis
An analysis of green stocks

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to determine whether refactoring code would make a program to analyse stock market data using for loops and nested loops in VBA run faster. Additionally, conditional formatting and the use of buttons were employed to make the analysis of the information easier to understand and more user-friendly. 

## Results
As the images below demonstrate, refactoring the code did in fact make the program run .0195187 seconds faster.

## Summary
1.The advantage of refactoring the code is that running the program will be faster now and anytime it is ran in the future.  It also also has the advantage of  creating a space to rethink the code and find ways to clean it up to be easier for someone else to read and to be more efficient.  The disadvantage of refactoring the code is that it is very time consuming and somewhat frustrating.  
2.By refactoring the original VBA script, the lessons learned in this module where put to practical use and the processes and syntax further understood.
